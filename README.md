# eecs183-final-project

Double check that everything is wired correctly. There should be two (2) wires between the Arduino and the breadboard, four (4) wires between the breadboard and the LED screen, and twelve (12) wires between the Arduino and the LED screen. (You will have more if youâ€™ve wired the potentiometer and/or the button.)
